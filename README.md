# aact-telemetry
 AACT Telemetry project for the NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge.
 
 As of right now, this repository contains *all* code related to the telemetry system. In the future, additional branches may be made to separate each project; but for the time being, code for each part of the telemetry system is split into their respective folders. Much of this code is inefficent and uncommented; however, feel free to view and edit the code as you wish.
 
 Due to my inexperience with licensing when dealing with dependencies, this repository contains no license file for the time being.
